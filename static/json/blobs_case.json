        "solution": "It\u2019s possible your retraction settings need to be adjusted slightly. Click on \u201cEdit Process Settings\u201d and go to the Extruders tab. Right below the retraction distance, there is a setting labeled \u201cExtra Restart Distance.\u201d This option determines the difference between the retraction distance when the extruder is stopping and the priming distance that is used when the extruder is restarting. If you notice a surface defect right at the beginning of the perimeter, then your extruder is likely priming too much plastic. You can reduce the priming distance by entering a negative value for the extra restart distance. For example, if your retraction distance is 1.0mm, and the extra restart distance is -0.2mm (note the negative sign), then each time your extruder stops, it will retract 1.0mm of plastic. However, each time the extruder has to start extruding again, it will only push 0.8mm of plastic back into the nozzle. Adjust this setting until the defect no longer appears when the extruder initially begins printing the perimeter.",

Enable this option and increase the value until you no longer notice a defect appearing at the end of each perimeter when the extruder is coming to a stop. Typically, a coasting distance between 0.2-0.5mm is enough to have a noticeable impact.",

        "solution": "The retraction and coasting settings mentioned above can help avoid defects each time the nozzle retracts, however, in some cases, it is better to simply avoid the retractions all together. This is particularly important for machines that use a Bowden extruder, as the long distance between the extruder motor and the nozzle makes retractions more troublesome. To adjust the settings that control when a retraction takes place, go to the Advanced tab and look for the \u201cOoze Control Behavior\u201d section. This section contains many useful settings that can modify the behavior of your 3D printer.",

Simplify3D includes an extremely useful feature that can divert the travel path of the extruder to avoid crossing an outline perimeter. If the extruder can avoid crossing the outline by changing the travel path, then a retraction won\u2019t be needed. To use this feature, simply enable the \u201cAvoid crossing outline for travel movement\u201d option.",

Next, go to the Advanced tab and enable the option labeled \u201cPerform retraction during wipe movement\u201d.

I also find good success if I turn off \"retract at layer change\" , and \"retract before outer wall\" is off too.
