If you retract too quickly, the filament may separate from the hot plastic inside the nozzle, or the quick movement of the drive gear may even grind away pieces of your filament. There is usually a sweet spot somewhere between 1200-6000 mm/min (20-100 mm/s) where retraction performs best.",

Just remember that print speed and extruder temperature are directly related. When you want to print faster you need to print it hotter to keep up with the demand of the extruder. Most effective thing I have found for stringing is reducing extruder temperature, print small stringing tests and knock the temp down in 5 degree increments until its gone. 200 is pretty hot for PLA, anything around 180-185 will probably give better results with significantly less stringing.",
