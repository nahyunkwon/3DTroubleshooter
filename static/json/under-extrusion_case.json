        "case_content": "Increase the Extrusion Multiplier",
        "solution": "If your filament diameter is correct, but you are still seeing under-extrusion issues, then you need to adjust your extrusion multiplier. If your extrusion multiplier was 1.0 previously and you change it to 1.05, it means you will be extruding 5% more plastic than you were previously. It is typical for PLA to print with an extrusion multiplier near 0.9, while ABS tends to have extrusion multipliers closer to 1.0. Try increasing your extrusion multiplier by 5%, and then reprint the test cube to see if you still have gaps between your perimeters.",

Finally, when the filament spool turns the next bit, flows normally for a few minutes, until it starts resisting again. Check your filament path between the spool and extruder, make sure it isn't catching on anything, check the spool to see if it rotates along the holder freely, and check to see if the filament is looped under or around itself on the spool causing extra tension.",
