        "solution": "Many machines come equipped with a heated bed that can help keep the bottom layers of your part warm throughout the print. For materials such as ABS, it is common to set the heated bed temperature to 100-120C, which will significantly reduce the amount of plastic shrinkage in these layers. If you are using simplify3D slicer, click on \u201cEdit Process Settings\u201d, select the Temperature tab, and then choose your Heated Bed from the list on the left-hand side. You can double-click on the temperature set point to edit the value.",

These features will help hold the edges down and may warp less, since they are typically only a few layers tall. If you need extra help, especially on smaller things, I'd go with a brim not a raft. Easier to take off and less filament wasted. ",
