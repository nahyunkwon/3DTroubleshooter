0,0,0,Incorrect Filament Diameter,,,Incorrect Filament Diameter: Simplify3D,"Check to make sure that this value matches the filament that you purchased. In Simplify3D, you can find this setting by clicking “Edit Process Settings” and going to the Other tab.",,
1,0,0,,0,I freshly installed Cura.,Incorrect Filament Diameter: Cura,"Check the filament diameter in the printer settings, it may be set to 2.85mm instead of 1.75mm. If this is a fresh install of Cura, it is possible that your filament size is set to 2.85 instead of 1.75 in your printer settings.",,
2,0,0,Increase the Extrusion Multiplier,,,Increase the Extrusion Multiplier,"If your filament diameter is correct, but you are still seeing under-extrusion issues, then you need to adjust your extrusion multiplier. If your extrusion multiplier was 1.0 previously and you change it to 1.05, it means you will be extruding 5% more plastic than you were previously. It is typical for PLA to print with an extrusion multiplier near 0.9, while ABS tends to have extrusion multipliers closer to 1.0. Try increasing your extrusion multiplier by 5%, and then reprint the test cube to see if you still have gaps between your perimeters.",https://community.ultimaker.com/topic/21490-feature-request-extrusion-multiplier-where-is-it/page/2/,
3,1,1,New machine/firmware?,1,I got the new printer or installed new firmware.,New Printer or Firmware,"Check whether the printer has volumetric extrusion enabled. If it is, disable it.",https://libredd.it/r/ender3/comments/f0ik8k/volumetric_extrusion_psa/,
4,1,0,Uneven filament supply,,,Uneven Filament supply,"My guess is that the roll of filament isn't spinning smoothly, so it drags and pulls against the extruder, causing the gaps. Finally, when the filament spool turns the next bit, flows normally for a few minutes, until it starts resisting again. Check your filament path between the spool and extruder, make sure it isn't catching on anything, check the spool to see if it rotates along the holder freely, and check to see if the filament is looped under or around itself on the spool causing extra tension.",,
5,1,1,,,,Partial or Fully Clogged Print Nozzle,"If the nozzle is clogged, there are several methods to resolve this. Please refer to the tutorial that is linked to this card.",https://rigid.ink/blogs/news/clogged-extruder-nozzle-what-causes-it-how-to-avoid-it-and-how-to-fix-it,
6,1,1,,,,"Can happen with burned filament, impurities in the filament or dust. ","Dust and dirt can still become adhered to your filament and travel with it down into your hot end. Once there, they burn in the heat of the nozzle and start adhering to the inside surface of the nozzle as carbon. Please refer to the tutorial that is linked to this card.",https://rigid.ink/blogs/news/clogged-extruder-nozzle-what-causes-it-how-to-avoid-it-and-how-to-fix-it,
7,1,,Wet filament,,,Wet Filament,"Could also be moisture in your filament, if it's not new maybe look into drying it. You can put filament in a dehydrator for a few hours. Otherwise, try a fresh roll of filament instead.",https://all3dp.com/2/how-to-dry-filament-pla-abs-and-nylon/,
8,1,,Calibration,,,Calibrate Extruder Steps (e steps),Calibrate e steps and flow rate then do a temperature tower.,https://all3dp.com/2/ender-3-calibration-how-to-calibrate-your-ender-3/,
9,1,,Print speed,,,Print Speed,You have to print slower at the very least with a smaller nozzle. Decrease the print speed.,https://3dprintscape.com/cura-speed/,
10,1,,Heat,2,I am using PLA at 180C or lower.,Extruder Temperature: Too low,"180 seems low for any PLA I have used, have you done a temp tower to determine the correct printing temperature for this filament? You could be too low which causes a clog and under-extrusion.",https://all3dp.com/2/the-best-printing-temperature-for-different-filaments/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CGSsDD6TMA
11,1,,,3,I am using PLA at 230C or above.,Extruder Temperature: Too high,230C is way too hot for PLA. You need to check if your extruder is slipping or if your filament is binding.,https://all3dp.com/2/the-best-printing-temperature-for-different-filaments/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CGSsDD6TMA
