0,0,0,Retraction Distance,,,Retraction Distance: Adjust retraction distance ,"If you encounter stringing with your prints, try increasing the retraction distance by 1mm and test again to see if the performance improves. What you could also try is retraction tower calibration from: [https://teachingtechyt.github.io/calibration.html#retraction]",https://teachingtechyt.github.io/calibration.html#retraction,
1,1,0,,0,My printer has bowden extruder.,Retraction Distance: Adjust retraction distance (with bowden extruder),Try changing your retraction if it's a bowden setup. 2mm is fine for direct drive but for a bowden tube with a mounted extruder your retraction will probably need to be more along the lines of 8mm or so at 30mm/s. I generally use 8mm at 45mm/s and still get minor stuff.,https://the3dprinterbee.com/cura-retraction-settings/,
2,1,0,,1,I am using extra long bowden tube.,Retraction Distance: Adjust retraction distance (with bowden extruder),"With bowden tube really depends on the tube length. I have extra long one so I my retraction is 6.6mm at 60mm/s.

3,1,0,,2,Retraction distance is above 10mm.,Retraction Distance: Too much retraction distance,10mm retract is too much. It should make clogging. Try decreasing the retraction distance by 1mm.,https://the3dprinterbee.com/cura-retraction-settings/,
4,0,0,Retraction speed,,,Retraction speed: Too low / high retraction speed,"If you retract too slowly, the plastic will slowly ooze down through the nozzle and may start leaking before the extruder is done moving to its new destination. If you retract too quickly, the filament may separate from the hot plastic inside the nozzle, or the quick movement of the drive gear may even grind away pieces of your filament. There is usually a sweet spot somewhere between 1200-6000 mm/min (20-100 mm/s) where retraction performs best.",https://the3dprinterbee.com/cura-retraction-settings/,
5,0,0,Temperature is too high,3,"I have already adjusted retraction settings, and still have stringing.",Printing temperature is too high,"If the printing temperature is too high, the plastic inside the nozzle will become less viscous and will leak out of the nozzle much more easily. However, if the temperature is too low, the plastic will still be somewhat solid and will have difficulty extruding from the nozzle. Try decreasing your extruder temperature by 5-10 degrees.",,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CGSsDD6TMA
6,1,0,,"4, 5",I am printing PLA at above 230°C with 0.4mm nozzle. / There are big blobs on the surface.,Extruder temperature is too high (PLA),"230°C is way too hot for PLA. When the material is that hot it will just ooze out of the nozzle between steps regardless of how fast and far your retraction is set to. Just remember that print speed and extruder temperature are directly related. When you want to print faster you need to print it hotter to keep up with the demand of the extruder. Most effective thing I have found for stringing is reducing extruder temperature, print small stringing tests and knock the temp down in 5 degree increments until its gone. 200 is pretty hot for PLA, anything around 180-185 will probably give better results with significantly less stringing.",https://all3dp.com/2/the-best-printing-temperature-for-different-filaments/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CGSsDD6TMA
7,1,0,,6,I am printing PLA with 0.8mm nozzle.,Extruder temperature is too high (PLA & 0.8mm nozzle),Try 220. I once had a 0.8 nozzle installed and had to use higher temps than normal. More plastic to melt.,https://all3dp.com/2/the-best-printing-temperature-for-different-filaments/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CGSsDD6TMA
8,0,0,Long movements over open spaces,7,I am using Simplify3D for slicing.,Long movements over open spaces,"The length of this movement can have a large impact on how much oozing takes place. Short moves may be quick enough that the plastic does not have time to ooze out of the nozzle. However, long movements are much more likely to create strings. Simplify3D includes an extremely useful feature that can help minimize the length of these movements. To use this feature, click on the Advanced tab and enable the “Avoid crossing outline for travel movement” option.",,
9,1,0,,8,I am using Cura for slicing.,Turn on combing when slicing.,"Turn on combing when slicing. If you have combing mode on, keep it on, but set it to ‘not-in-skin’. Combing will wipe the nozzle on the printed part before moving, and it seems to really help. Setting combing to all will just mess up prints later down the line.",https://www.lpomykal.cz/cura-combing-mode/,
10,0,0,Movement Speed,,,You may also find that increasing the movement speed of your machine can also reduce the amount of time that the extruder can ooze when moving between parts.,"The X/Y Axis Movement Speed represents the side-to-side travel speed, and is frequently directly related to the amount of time your extruder spends moving over open air. If your machine can handle moving at higher speeds, you may find that increasing this settings can also reduce stringing between parts.",https://3dprintscape.com/cura-speed/,
11,1,0,,0,My printer has bowden extruder.,Travel speed,"Try getting your travel speed to 150 or higher, also configure linear advance. It’s very useful on a bowden setup",https://3dprintscape.com/cura-speed/,
12,1,1,Larger nozzle diameter,9,I use PETG and 0.8mm nozzle.,Need a nozzle with smaller diameter,I'm thinking that a 0.8mm nozzle with petg on a print that small is going to have stringing no matter what you do. Just the wrong combo. A 0.8mm nozzle is going to be leakier than a sieve with PETG. Try different material other than PETG or use different nozzle with the lower size.,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrqZgU8G3rQ
13,1,0,Z-hop,10,I turned on Z hop when slicing.,Turn Z hop off,Turn Z hop off. It's a plague on stringing.,https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/issues/7108,
14,1,0,Outer wall wipe distance,,,Enable outer wall wipe distance,"Enable outer wall wipe distance for half of your nozzle diameter (0.2mm if you have a 0.4mm nozzle). In the Cura guide: ""With this setting, at the end of every outer wall, the nozzle will travel slightly further without extrusion, wiping the contour closed."" The recommended value is 0.2~0.4mm",https://community.ultimaker.com/topic/35891-outer-wall-wipe-distance/,
15,1,0,Temperature tower,,,Finding the optimal extruder temperature: Temperature tower,Try a temp tower to see what temps work best for your filament.,https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2729076,
16,1,0,Excessive extrusion amount,,,Excessive extrusion amount,"Sometimes, stringing may be an extrusion problem. If you are laying down too much plastic, then a little bit might build up, especially on small layer that are solid infill. When this happens, a bit of plastic might cling to the extruder and get dragged across during travel moves. Try decreasing your extrusion ratio / flow percentage, and see if there is any effect.",https://3dprintbeginner.com/flow-rate-calibration/,
17,1,0,Coasting,,,Turn on Coasting,Turn on coasting in Cura when slicing.,https://all3dp.com/2/cura-coasting-settings-explained/,
18,1,1,Ptfe tube not properly in a hot end,,,Ptfe tube not properly in a hot end,"Check if the ptfe tube is fully in the hot end. Try taking off the ptfe tube and nozzle and stick something through the nozzle hole to push out any excess filament out of the hot end, and then put the nozzle back on and push the ptfe tube as far down as you can. Sometimes if there's residue in the hot end the ptfe tube will stop before it reaches the nozzle and then when you heat it back up it'll form a gap that causes the stringing. Make sure when you insert the ptfe tube into it again you turn the temp up just in case you missed any residue.",,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VmlZniuSa4
19,1,0,Wet filament,,,Wet filament,"Could also be moisture in your filament, if it's not new maybe look into drying it. Every time I've started to get even a little bit of stringing issues I'll toss my filament in a dehydrator for a few hours and my problems are solved until it happens again. Otherwise, try a fresh roll of filament instead.",https://all3dp.com/2/how-to-dry-filament-pla-abs-and-nylon/,
