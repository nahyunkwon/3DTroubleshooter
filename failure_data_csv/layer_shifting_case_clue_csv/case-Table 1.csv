0,0,0,,,Toolhead is moving too fast,"If you feel that your printer may be moving too fast, try to reduce the printing speed by 50% to see if it helps . Print speed shouldn't really go over 40mm/s if you want a quality print on *most* machines. ",https://3dprintscape.com/cura-speed/,
1,0,1,,,Belt is too loose or tight,"Ideal assembly requires a belt that is somewhat tight to prevent slipping, but not too tight to where the system is unable to rotate. If you start noticing issues with misaligned layers, you should verify that your belts all have the appropriate tension, and none appear to be too loose or too tight.",,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPAs-DzgOWM
2,0,1,,,"Set-screw too loose, not tightened enough.","Set-screws anchor the pulley to the shaft of the motor so that the two items spin together. If the set-screw loosens, the pulley will no longer rotate together with the motor shaft. You should verify that all of the motor fasteners are properly tightened.",,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgfTVNBRRTo

7,1,0,,,Jerk/acceleration settings are too high,I find all jerk settings should be 10mm/s and master print speed shouldn't really go over 40mm/s if you want a quality print on *most* machines. It may also be prudent to check and possibly reduce acceleration speeds.,https://3dprintscape.com/cura-jerk-settings-how-to-set-them/,

11,1,1,,,"Check your wheels. Every single wheel can be tightened or loosened, and become loose over long periods of time and use.","Start with the eccentric nut wheels, tighten them ever so slightly, and then lightly roll the wheel with your finger, you should be able to move the bed/x axis with a bit of force but not too much, and you shouldn't have to press the wheel in. The other wheels can be tightened by their primary bolt/screw holding the wheel in place, same procedure. ",,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsEdU8ZtI6U

13,1,1,,,3D printer is not properly leveled during assembly,"You may want to check if your machine is properly leveled. And I mean the machine frame itself, should be square and level to the base of the machine and on a properly flat and level surface, only after that can the bed be leveled in relation to the frame and x axis so that everything is leveled and squared up. If your frame is unlevel, consider rebuilding it carefully. ",,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Th2e7wTNV0
