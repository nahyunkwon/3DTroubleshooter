0,0,0,Use a Heated Bed,,,Use a Heated Bed: Increase bed temperature,"Many machines come equipped with a heated bed that can help keep the bottom layers of your part warm throughout the print. For materials such as ABS, it is common to set the heated bed temperature to 100-120C, which will significantly reduce the amount of plastic shrinkage in these layers. If you are using simplify3D slicer, click on “Edit Process Settings”, select the Temperature tab, and then choose your Heated Bed from the list on the left-hand side. You can double-click on the temperature set point to edit the value.",,
1,1,1,,,,Uneven Bed Temperature,It could just be uneven bed temperatures. One solution could be: setting the bed temperature on the printer's control panel and preheating it before sending it a print. The other solution could be checking if the bed is leveled properly.,https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/12031/is-there-any-way-to-correct-uneven-bed-temperature,
2,1,0,,0,Bed temperature is lower than 80C.,Use a Heated Bed: Increase bed temperature,80C is way too low on the bed. My experience has been that 110C on the bed for the first 2 layers or so making it bite properly to the bed. Then lower to 100C through the rest of the print.,https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/12031/is-there-any-way-to-correct-uneven-bed-temperature,
3,0,0,Disable Fan Cooling,,,Disable Fan Cooling,"As cooling can cause warping, many users prefer to disable any external cooling fans entirely when printing with materials such as ABS. Leave the fan off for a few layers (e.g., first 1 or 2 layers), and make sure there are no drafts near the printer",https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/c2wydr/turn_of_fan_for_first_layer_in_cura/,
4,0,1,Use a Heated Enclosure,,,Use a Heated Enclosure,"While a heated bed can keep the bottom layers of your part warm, it may struggle to keep the upper layers of the part from contracting once you start printing taller and taller objects. In this situation, you may find it useful to place your printer inside of an enclosure that can help regulate the temperature of the entire build volume.",https://www.amazon.com/Creality-Fireproof-Dustproof-Printer-Enclosure/dp/B08GFNKD9M,
5,0,0,Better Adhesion: Brims and Rafts,,,Brim or Raft,"If you have already tried all of the other suggestions, but your parts are still curling later on in the print, then you can also try including a brim or a raft with your print. These features will help hold the edges down and may warp less, since they are typically only a few layers tall. If you need extra help, especially on smaller things, I'd go with a brim not a raft. Easier to take off and less filament wasted. ",https://all3dp.com/2/3d-printing-raft-brim-and-skirt-all-you-need-to-know/,
6,1,0,Better Adhesion: Sticking method,1,I am printing small multiple parts at once.,Better Adhesion: Sticking method,"Try using painters tape, a glue stick or hairspray for better adhesion. Glue stick and hair spray are less messy than they sound, and as noted before, it's good for multiple prints. If you do end up going the glue stick route, they make fat ones to make laying it on thin and consistent easier/faster. ",,
7,1,0,Better Adhesion: Clean Bed,2,Bed is not clean due to the previous prints.,Better Adhesion: Clean Bed,Try cleaning you bed with soap and water or with 70% isopropyl wipes for every print.,,
8,1,0,Bad Material Choice,3,I am using ABS.,Bad Material Choice,"ABS is an antiquated material. It has horrible shrinkage properties, and the larger, more dense the object, the worse it gets. Try PETG. Or PLA if you need no special features of ABS like heat resistance. I use ABS only for small objects (and you need a heated chamber)",,
9,1,0,Print Placement on Bed,,,Print Placement on Bed: Keep prints in warmest zone,"One last idea - change the bed placement to diagonal, so you're keeping everything in the warmest zone of the bed heater. It tends to be cooler on the outside edges. Not critical for most prints, but definitely for what you're doing.",,
10,1,1,Better Adhesion: Uneven bed,,,Better Adhesion: Uneven bed,How about bed leveling? Proper leveling really well makes the prints stick very well. Also first thing is to check first layer. And print closer if possible. ,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EfWVUJjBdA
11,1,1,Printing Sheet,4,I am using PLA.,Use Printing Sheet,"If you are using PLA, you might want to use the smooth sheet if you have it. It's almost miraculous for PLA. ",,
12,1,1,Draft Shield,5,There is draft where my printer is located.,"Draft Shield: Check for drafts, an open window can do this.",Large prints like this will always have warping problem even with PLA. You can put a cardboard box around your printer to keep the print away from the cold air. You can also use ‘draft shield’ setting in Cura. It generates a printed wall around the 3D print.  ,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uClZoz0WWY
13,1,0,Cold extruder,,,Better Adhesion: Cold extruder,Low print temperature can cause warping. The will be much less later adhesion at such low temperature. Try increasing the print temperature.,https://all3dp.com/2/the-best-printing-temperature-for-different-filaments/,
